# complexCGR 

A complex representation for DNA, that preserves some properties of the CGR from the 'Chaos Game Representation for gene structure' by Jeffrey in 1990.

Each nucleotide will be assigned to one quadrant (I,II,III and IV). This distribution will be the same for the CGR and complexCGR implementations (I:A,II:C,III:G,IV:T)
